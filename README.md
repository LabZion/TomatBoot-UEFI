# TomatBoot for UEFI

## UEFI Library

The uefi library consists mainly of headers and source files taken directly from [EDK2](https://github.com/tianocore/edk2). The reason for that is 
to cut on development time and use existing headers, but not using EDK2 build system.

The license of EDK2 can be found [here](lib/uefi/License.txt) and is redistributed under that license. Note that the rest of the code is
distributed as the main license file shows.
